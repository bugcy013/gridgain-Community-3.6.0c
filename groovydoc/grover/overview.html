<h2 class="header">Overview</h2>
<code>Grover</code> is the main object that encapsulates Grover DSL. It includes global functions
on <code>"grover"</code> keyword and helper converters. <code>grover</code> also
mimics many methods in <code>GridFactory</code> class from Java side.
<p>
The idea behind Scalar DSL - <i>zero additional logic and only conversions</i> implemented
using Groovy++ type inference. Note that most of the Grover DSL development happened on Java
side of GridGain 3.0 product line - Java APIs had to be adjusted quite significantly to
support natural adaptation of functional APIs. That basically means that all functional
logic must be available on Java side and Grover only provides conversions from Grover
language constructs to Java constructs. Note that currently GridGain supports Groovy 1.8
and up only.
<p>
This design approach ensures that Java side does not starve and usage paradigm
is mostly the same between Java and Groovy++ - yet with full power of Groovy++ behind.
In other words, Grover only adds Groovy++ specifics, but not greatly altering semantics
of how GridGain APIs work. Most of the time the code in Grover can be written in
Java in almost the same number of lines.

<h2 class="header">Suffix '$' In Names</h2>
Symbol `$` is used in names when they conflict with the names in the base Java class
that Grover is shadowing or with Java package name that your Groovy++ code is importing.
Instead of giving two different names to the same function we've decided to simply mark
Groovy++'s side method with `$` suffix.

<h2 class="header">Importing</h2>
Grover needs to be imported in a proper way so that necessary objects got available in the scope:
<pre name="code" class="groovy">
import static org.gridgain.grover.Grover.*
import org.gridgain.grover.categories.*
import org.gridgain.grover.lang.*
</pre>
Any class that uses Grover should also be annotated like so:
<pre name="code" class="groovy">
&#64;Typed
&#64;Use(GroverCacheProjectionCategory)
class MyClass {
    ...
}
</pre>

<h2 class="header">Examples</h2>
Here are few short examples of how Scalar can be used to program routine distributed
task. All examples below use default GridGain configuration and default grid. All these
examples take an implicit advantage of auto-discovery and failover, load balancing and
collision resolution, zero deployment and many other underlying technologies in the
GridGain - while remaining absolutely distilled to the core domain logic.

This code snippet prints out full topology:
<pre name="code" class="groovy">
grover { -> grid$.each { n -> println("Node: " + n.id8()) } }
</pre>
The obligatory example - cloud enabled <code>Hello World!</code>. It splits the phrase
into multiple words and prints each word on a separate grid node:
<pre name="code" class="groovy">
grover { -> grid$.run(SPREAD, "Hello World!".split(" ").collect { w -> { -> println(w) } } ) }
</pre>
This example broadcasts message to all nodes:
<pre name="code" class="groovy">
grover { -> grid$.run(BROADCAST) { println("Broadcasting!!!") } }
</pre>
