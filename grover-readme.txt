Grover README

Grover is a Groovy++ based Domain Specific Language (DSL) that is build on top of GridGain APIs and runtime. The main purpose of Grover is to adopt GridGain APIs to Groovy++ language and provide simpler and smoother usage model for those who chose to use Groovy++ language when working with GridGain. 

Keep in mind that you can use GridGain APIs directly from any Groovy++ based application and there is no technical need for Grover - but with Grover many things are easier and more natural when working with GridGain and Groovy++ language.
