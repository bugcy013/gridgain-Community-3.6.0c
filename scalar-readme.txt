Scalar README

Scalar is a Scala-based Domain Specific Language (DSL) that is build on top of GridGain APIs and runtime. The main purpose of Scalar is to adopt GridGain APIs to Scala language and provide simpler and smoother usage model for those who chose to use Scala language when working with GridGain. We highly recommend Scala as the main language to be used with GridGain as it provides much reacher environment for distributed development with GridGain.

Scalar does not add any new functionality to GridGain but rather provides implicit and explicit conversions to adapt Java APIs to Scala language. Keep also in mind that you can use GridGain APIs directly from any Scala-based application and there is no technical need for Scalar - but with Scalar many things are easier and more natural when working with GridGain and Scala language.
