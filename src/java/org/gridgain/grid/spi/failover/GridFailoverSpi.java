/**
 * Failover SPI provides developer with ability to supply custom logic for handling
 * failed execution of a grid job. Job execution can fail for a number of reasons:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>Job execution threw an exception (runtime, assertion or error)</li>
 *      <li>Node on which job was execution left topology (crashed or stopped)</li>
 *      <li>Collision SPI on remote node cancelled a job before it got a chance to execute (job rejection).</li>
 * </ul>
 * In all cases failover SPI takes failed job (as failover context) and list of all
 * grid nodes and provides another node on which the job execution will be retried.
 * It is up to failover SPI to make sure that job is not mapped to the node it
 * failed on. The failed node can be retrieved from
 * {@link GridJobResult#getNode() GridFailoverContext.getJobResult().node()}
 * method.
 * <p>
 * GridGain comes with the following built-in failover SPI implementations:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>{@link org.gridgain.grid.spi.failover.never.GridNeverFailoverSpi}</li>
 *      <li>{@link org.gridgain.grid.spi.failover.always.GridAlwaysFailoverSpi}</li>
 *      <li>{@link org.gridgain.grid.spi.failover.jobstealing.GridJobStealingFailoverSpi}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> this SPI (i.e. methods in this interface) should never be used directly. SPIs provide
 * internal view on the subsystem and is used internally by GridGain kernal. In rare use cases when
 * access to a specific implementation of this SPI is required - an instance of this SPI can be obtained
 * via {@link Grid#configuration()} method to check its configuration properties or call other non-SPI
 * methods. Note again that calling methods from this interface on the obtained instance can lead
 * to undefined behavior and explicitly not supported.
